This data visualization showcases three factors to compare across the twenty-two countries: maximum duration of legally required maternity leave, maximum duration of legally required paternity leave, and the relative percentage of income paid during maternity leave. Although slivers of a circle are used to represent each country, they are equally sized, as opposed to a traditional pie chart. Instead, how many days each mother and father are alloted off from work after the birth of their child is portrayed by the length of a line, extending from the center of the circle outwards. To demostrated the last factor, percentage of earns retained, the thickness of the ring around the circle is altered accordingly. Notable, the United States is the only country included in this graphic without universal, guaranteed maternity or paternity leave. Also, there is a strong trend of generally longer maternity leaves than paternity leaves and a lack of mentioning paternal earnings.
